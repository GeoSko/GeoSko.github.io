The project will deliver a research prototype for the automated monitoring of patients with respiratory allergy and the development of notification services for these patients, based on kinetic and acoustic characteristics, collected from wearables and mobile devices. The crowdsourced information, collected both from sensors and other smart devices and the patient?s self-assessment, will be exploited by health professionals to better control and manage seasonal symptoms in allergic diseases in support to decision making in the allergy related medical sector.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>P.A.T.
